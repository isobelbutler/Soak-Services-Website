	<h2>Complete soakage testing service</h2>
	<div class=first>
		<h3>What do Soak Services do?</h3>
		<p>We carry out infiltration testing for drainage engineers, property developers and planning consultants. This is also known as soakage or percolation testing. </p>

		<h3>What is infiltration testing?</h3>
		<p>Infiltration testing is necessary for Sustainable Urban Drainage Systems (SUDS), drainage design or planning approval from local authority planners or the Environment Agency.</p>

		<h3>How does it work?</h3>
		<p>We will excavate trial pits where you require and will conduct infiltration tests in accordance with BRE 365 or BS6 297 (foul water) standards.</p>
		<p>We supply the plant needed to excavate the pits and can supply the water if none is available on site.</p>
		
		<h3>What do you get?</h3>
		<p>You will receive a comprehensive report with accurate data, photographic evidence and calculations necessary for your drainage design or planning application.</p>

	<h2>Calculations are presented in a clear, easy-to-read report.</h2>
	<p>Soak Services specialise in infiltration testing that conforms to the BRE 365 and BS6 297 standards and can complete others upon request. </p>

		<p>To complete the testing we excavate pits, fill them with water, and  measure the rate the water drains away, giving us the drainage rate. For unstable grounds we can use a perforated pipe and fill the pit with washed shingle. We then present these calculations in a clear, easy-to-read report.
